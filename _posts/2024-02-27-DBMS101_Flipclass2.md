# Topic : Entity Relationship Modeling for E-Health Record
=======================================================================================================

## Entity Relationship Model (My understanding of ERD)

The Entity Relationship Model (ERM) is a method used to organize and represent pieces of data before creating a database. It helps developers and viewers understand how each piece of data will be connected to one another through a visual representation, such as a diagram.


### An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)  includes

#### 1.Entities:
Represented as rectangles, an entity represents a primary table that records health information that healthcare professionals and databases should record for smooth functionality. We include patients, appointments, doctors, medical conditions, and medications.

#### 2.Attributes:
Attributes are the characteristics or properties that define specific aspects of entities, represented using ovals connected to their respective entities. For example, for patient attributes, the name of patients, CID number, and other details are important properties defining a patient's attributes.

#### 3.Cardinality:
Cardinality describes the relationship between connected entities and is represented by using symbols near the relationship lines in an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

#### 4.Relationships:
Relationships show how entities are connected to each other using lines.

#### 5.Primary Keys:
Primary keys uniquely identify each record in an entity. For example, in a patient entity, a CID number is a unique property that represents an individual person.
