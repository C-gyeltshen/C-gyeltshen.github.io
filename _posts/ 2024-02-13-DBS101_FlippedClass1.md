## Topic : Database Administrators and Database Users

### Database Administrator (DBA)

A Database Administrator is an IT professional who is in charge of creating, maintaining a secure database, and giving access to authorized users.


### Roles and Responsibilities of Database Administrator:
 - Conducts regular audits to ensure proper functioning and security of the database.
 - Maintains a smooth flow of data between the database and the service provider.
 - Creates backup and recovery plans to prevent the loss of data in emergency cases.

### Database Users:

- Any person who uses a database and avails benefits from the database is known as a database user in DBMS (Database Management System).

### There are 8 types of database users including the Database Administrator.

#### Database Administrator (DBA):

A Database Administrator (DBA) is a person who controls all three levels of the database, namely View Level, Logical Level, and Physical Level

The Database Administratorâ€™s responsibility is to keep the database secure and allow only the authorized users to access/modify the database.

#### Naive / Parametric End Users:

Naives are users who do not have key knowledge of how the database functions, but they frequently use database applications in their daily life to get the required information.

Examples of Naive users are clerks in banks who use a database system to perform their tasks but do not know how a database actually works.

#### System Analysis:

A person who analyzes all the requirements of naive users to perform their tasks smoothly.

Checks all the requirements of a naive user whether they are satisfied or not.

#### Sophisticated Users:

Sophisticated users are engineers, scientists, and business analysts who are familiar with databases and can build database applications according to their own requirements.

#### Database Designers:

Database designers design all the database structures before the data is fed into the database.

A database designer's responsibility is to store all the required data and understand the requirements of different user groups to create a design that satisfies the needs of all the user groups.

#### Application Programmers:

An application programmer is a back-end programmer who writes the code for an application that databases use to take the user's inputs and responses.

Application programmers design, debug, test, and maintain the standards of the application to remove all the burdens from the naive users and customers so that they can interact with the databases easily.

#### Casual Users / Temporary Users:

Casual Users are those users who occasionally use the database to get new information like managers.

#### Specialized Users:

Specialized users are sophisticated users who write specialized database applications that are totally new to the database.
