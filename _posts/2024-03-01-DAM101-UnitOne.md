# DAM101 Unit One (Deep Learning Fundamentals)

## Take Aways from unit one 

What is AI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be simply defined as an ***imitation of human behaviors by a machine***. AI came into existence in 1957 when a programmer wrote code that can play checkers against him, and this process of creating a bot that can play checkers gradually became a technology known as Artificial Intelligence.

## Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning:

### Machine Learning (ML):

* AI is the big idea of making computers smart enough to think like a human, in which machine learning is a method to accomplish those goals. Therefore, machine learning is also called a ***subset of AI***.
* It can train on a ***small*** set of data.
* Can train on a CPU (central processing unit).
* Makes simple and linear correlations.

### Deep Learning:

* Machine learning is a big toolbox to make a computer think smart like a human, which needs ***human intervention to learn and to correct***. But deep learning is the next evolution which can learn by itself by reflecting on past results; therefore, it's called a ***subset of machine learning***.

* It requires a large set of data.
* Needs computational resources like GPU (graphics processing unit) to train.
* Makes non-linear and complex correlations.
