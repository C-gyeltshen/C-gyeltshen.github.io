# DAM101 Unit One (Deep Learning Fundamentals)

## Take Aways from unit one

What is AI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be simply defined as an ***imitation of human behaviors by a machine***. AI came into existence in 1957 when a programmer wrote code that can play checkers against him, and this process of creating a bot that can play checkers gradually became a technology known as Artificial Intelligence.

## Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning:

### Machine Learning (ML):

* AI is the big idea of making computers smart enough to think like a human, in which machine learning is a method to accomplish those goals. Therefore, machine learning is also called a ***subset of AI***.
* It can train on a ***small*** set of data.
* Can train on a CPU (central processing unit).
* Makes simple and linear correlations.

### Deep Learning:

* Machine learning is a big toolbox to make a computer think smart like a human, which needs ***human intervention to learn and to correct***. But deep learning is the next evolution which can learn by itself by reflecting on past results; therefore, it's called a ***subset of machine learning***.

* It requires a large set of data.
* Needs computational resources like GPU (graphics processing unit) to train.
* Makes non-linear and complex correlations.

### How does a neural network learn? 
Training a neural network is akin to teaching a toddler to speak for the first time. At the outset, the network begins with **no prior knowledge**, and through a process of **repetition and reinforcement**, it adjusts its internal parameters. As the training progresses, the network improves its ability to predict outcomes.

### Artificial neurons

Artificial neurons are connection points in an artificial neural network. Artificial neural networks, like biological neural networks, have a layered architecture, and each node has the capability of processing the input data and forwarding the output data on the network.

### Single Layered Perceptron

A single-layer perceptron is the simplest form of a feedforward neural network, consisting of only one layer of perceptron . In this architecture, there are no hidden layers between the input and output layers.
